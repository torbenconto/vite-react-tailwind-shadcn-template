# Title
This is a template for a README.md file. It is a good practice to include a README file in your projects. This file should contain information about the project, how to use it, how to install it, and how to contribute to it. It is also a good idea to include a license in the README file. This will help others understand how they can use your project.

# Run
`bun i` / `npm i` - to install the dependencies
